	<dd>
		This project represents the ongoing effort to fully specify the semantics of the C programming language using the semantic definitional framework K.
		My contributions were described in my <a href="#ellison-2012-phd-dissertation">dissertation</a>, a paper on the <a href="#ellison-rosu-2012-popl">positive semantics</a>, and a <a href="#ellison-rosu-2012-tr">technical report</a>/<a href="#hathhorn-ellison-rosu-2015-pldi">paper</a> on the negative semantics.
		For this project, I used continuous integration and a huge number of integration and regression tests to make sure the semantics stayed correct as it became more complete.

	<dd>
		This project is a collaboration between me and <a href="https://davidlazar.org/">David Lazar</a> to give an executable semantics to the LLVM assembly language (LLVM IR) in the K Semantic Framework.
		A significant subset of the language was defined, but the work was not completed.
