<h3>Major</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics">C-Semantics</a></li>
	This project represents the ongoing effort to fully specify the semantics of the C programming language using the semantic definitional framework K.
	My contribution was the original effort, as described in my <a href="#ellison-2012-phd-dissertation">dissertation</a>, a paper on the <a href="#ellison-rosu-2012-popl">positive semantics</a>, and technical report on the <a href="#ellison-rosu-2012-tr">negative semantics</a>.
	For this project, I used continuous integration and a huge number of integration and regression tests to make sure the semantics got more and more correct.
	<li><a href="https://github.com/davidlazar/llvm-semantics">LLVM-Semantics</a></li>
	This project is a collaboration between me and <a href="https://davidlazar.org/">David Lazar</a> to give an executable semantics to the LLVM assembly language (LLVM IR) in the K Semantic Framework.
	A significant subset of the language was defined, but the work was completed.
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ellisonch/ricochet">Ricochet</a></li>
	Ricochet RPC is an RPC framework for C# focusing on speed and robustness.

	Simple bootstrapped two-sample t-test in C#.
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ellisonch/gertrude">Getrude</a></li>
	Gertrude is a simple term rewriting language, written in Go.
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ellisonch/rust-stopwatch">Stopwatch</a></li>
	A small library for Rust (my first foray into learning the language) used for timing things.
	WarpWallet is a brain wallet generator (for Bitcoin).
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ellisonch/warpwallet">WarpWallet</a></li>
	This is an implementation of <a href="https://keybase.io/warp">WarpWallet</a> in Go.
